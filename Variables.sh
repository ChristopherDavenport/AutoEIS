## Now I need you to fill in these variables for me(I have filled in a few standards but you will want to do a little more. Atleast change passwords)

#JAVA_HOME is assigned in java install that way if you update java it happens all in 1 place
JAVADIR=/usr/java                                               #ex /usr/java


EIS_CONTAINER=/u01/ellucian
EIS_HOME=${EIS_CONTAINER}/EllucianIdentityService
